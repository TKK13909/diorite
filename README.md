# Summary
## Goal
The goal of this project is to provide an alternative to closed-source music notation programs.

If you want something like this that actually works, check out the open-source [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/index.html)!

## Contributing
This is a new idea I have been mulling over and may not actually take form. If you would like to help me make this idea a reality then I would love your help!

# TODO
- [ ] Decide on file format
    
    Options:
